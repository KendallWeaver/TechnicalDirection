3 kinds of data storage
- persistent playing storage
	data will be persistent in the editor
	we want "build" persistent data
	we need to creat something that will store the data
btw use graphic scaler on your UI so it can scale well

player preferences have been serialized

anytime you want to share data, you should use a scriptable object
serialized means it can be transmitted as a different type of data and stored
(Actual script will be on his twitch vod)

He's been sayihng stuff like "JaSan"??? it sounds like jason
OH IT"S ON HIS GIT REPO

Artician dreams tools??? IDK you'll have look for it. 

He makes 3 public UnityEvent 
formatted like 
public UnityEvent AwakeEvent, StartEvent, QuitEvent;

in the functions, it's like 
AwakeEvent.Evoke();
adding the script to the canvas makes the events available where you can call other events in other scriptable objects

He goes over a system that could be good for checkpoints
he uses... vector 3 objects i think?
He has a system where you can save a vector3 location
then he can have an event where when the object is dragged (by putting the current location in the event field), it saves the location

He uses a storage object where the current location will be stored.
the data storage object will be used to pull data to figure out where the location should be
	trying to get the same location where the ring originally was

unity has a cloud storage system apparently

serialized data is protected and encrypted so it can be edited from outside
